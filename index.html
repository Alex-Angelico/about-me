                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Ricardo. I am the first U.S. born member of my extended family. My mother, father, brother and sister crossed the Mexican border 
                    illegaly through the Arizona desert. I was born in Phoenix, AZ. My first and primary language growing up was Spanish. I moved out when I was
                    16 years old and passed my G.E.D. I graduated from Universal Technical Institute in 2011 studying Auto/diesel and Industrial technology. There
                    were a lot of things happening in between all of that, the devil is in the details. For about a year between 2011 and 2012 I was homeless. I
                    traveled to Las Vegas to live with my brother and his family. I got a job at a doctor's office where I worked for 6 years. My wife and I
                    started dating while playing Pokemon Go. We moved to Washington to get out of the desert.
